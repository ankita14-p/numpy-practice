# NumPy Practice with Google Colab 🧮

This repository contains my hands-on practice notebooks created using **Google Colab** as I learn and explore **NumPy**, the foundational Python library for numerical computing.

## 📌 Why I Made This

I'm learning NumPy as part of my preparation for real-world **AI/ML projects**, including medical applications like **lung and brain cancer detection**. These Colab notebooks help me:
- Build strong fundamentals
- Document everything I practice
- Quickly refer back during future projects

## 🚀 What’s Covered

- ✅ Importing NumPy and comparing speed with lists
- ✅ Creating 1D and 2D arrays
- ✅ Arrays of 0s, 1s, identity matrix
- ✅ Arrays with specific values and data types
- ✅ Random floats and integers
- ✅ Evenly spaced values (`arange`, `linspace`)
- ✅ Array operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- ✅ Transpose, reshape, flatten
- ✅ Array info: shape, size, ndim, dtype

🔜 Coming Soon:
- Indexing and slicing
- Boolean filtering
- Broadcasting
- Stacking and concatenation
